# MVVMC Xcode Templates

Generate Swift source code for the MVVMC architecture.

The __Scene__ template will create the ViewModel, ViewModelProtocol, ViewModelDelegate, ViewController, Coordinator, and RouteParameters. It includes a todo/checklist in the view controller to help guide you through the remaining steps of getting a new scene ready.

## Installation

To install the Xcode templates, run the following:

```
make install
```

To uninstall them, run:

```
make uninstall
```
