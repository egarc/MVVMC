/// A `NavigationCoordinator` is responsible for managing the presentation and dismissal of a single
/// scene. Many will be responsible for child coordinators, and will communicate changes up the
/// chain with the use of delegates.
///
/// When popping/dismissing views, the view controllers are responsible for relaying their dismissal
/// to the viewmodel, which relays it to the coordinator. The coordinator may then relay that to its
/// own delegate, which is likely responsible for the view that is now visible.
///
/// Coordinators that need to build a store or viewmodel with parameters do so by pulling the
/// parameters out of the corresponding Route.
public protocol NavigationCoordinator {

    /// The `Scene` directly related to the coordinator and what it is presenting.
    ///
    /// Most coordinators should have an `associatedScene`, but there can be exceptions that aren't
    /// tied to a specific scene.
    ///
    /// The `nextRoute(fromRoutes:)` extension makes use of this property by comparing the first
    /// `route.scene` to the `associatedScene` and removing it from the array if it matches.
    var associatedScene: Scene? { get }
    
    /// Creates required view controllers and navigation stack and presents the desired scene.

    /// Each coordinator must make a decision on how to handle all the scenes it supports.
    /// Typically, if the scene is not the `associatedScene`, it will create a child coordinator
    /// and pass the remaining routes on to the child. If a coordinator receives an unsupported
    /// scene it should stop trying to navigate any further.
    ///
    /// If the scene is the one directly related to a coordinator, it should create and present
    /// the relevant view controller.
    ///
    /// It is possible for a coordinator to ignore a path of scenes if requirements for displaying
    /// the scene are not met. The primary example of this would be when attempting to display a
    /// scene that requires authentication while not authenticated.
